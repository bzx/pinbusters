## But.. what does it do?

This extension hides all Pinterest images that appear in your Google Image Search. Well, technically it creates an overlay with Pinbusters logo on top of them, so that you know where *not to* click. 

However, you can still click that image, and you will see the expanded image panel in its original form, with the "pinned" image displayed and original functionality available.

## But.. why?

#### tldr;

It's a time saver.

#### I still don't get it

All images that you can find on Pinterest come from other websites, so in order to reach that original website, you need to go through Pinterest. This is not always straightforward as the "pinned" image you're after may not appear as the first image on the Pinterest page, so you will still have to look for it. As soon as you scroll down a bit, Pinterest will require you to login.. and by that time you probably wish you didn't click that image in the first place (you may have an active Pinterest account.. but you get the point).

Furthermore, some images "pinned" to Pinterest are automatically scaled down, which may affect original image quality.
